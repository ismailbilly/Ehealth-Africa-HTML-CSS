        <p>Gaining admission into the university was a dream come true.Though I chose computer engineering as a course of choice, i really did not know what the curriculum was or the 
             different fields in computer engineering. 
             For me it was just a funky course name my friend
             was studying and it was cool.
             What matters was i was admitted into college.  </p>
        
        <h3 id="findpurpose">Finding my Purpose</h3>
        <p>Registration was over and lectures started, I was super excited. 
            The curriculum was given to us and I saw some codes and course names,
            though very unfamiliar but they look interesting.
        The journey of programming started with FORTRAN. At first it looked like I was in the wrong class as
         I was unable to understand what the lecturer  was saying and writing. 
         AH! Thank God mid semester came and I packed my bags thinking never to come back, frustrated and confused. 
         I remember once I spoke to my mum over the phone and I was crying telling her I do not understand FORTRAN. I got home feeling really down just like most of my classmates.
      My mum was very worried, she discussed the issue with a colleague who is a computer engineer at work and he invited me over.
      OH! God that chap was a savior. He broke it down that I felt I could create my own programming language lol.   </p>

        <p>Semester break was over and I returned to school,refreshed and more confident.
            The next day was the last FORTRAN lecture for the semester and the lectured grouped
            us in fives with assignment to be presented in three days. Everyone in my group semester
            not to be interested as they still lived in my past of lack of understanding of the course
            . I took it up as challenge and started googling for ideas, I went to the library and brusheed through some 
            textbooks on FORTRAN and that was my brekthrough. I was able to do the assignment and even went
            ahead to do the presentation. My group was the best and I was named the best in programming that semester. I was very happy.
            That moment birthed my journey into programming.
